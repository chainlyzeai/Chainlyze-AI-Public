# ðŸ‘› Wallet Profiler

Chainlyze offers a comprehensive Wallet Profiling feature that allows users to deeply understand and monitor wallet activities across various blockchain networks. This feature is particularly valuable for anyone interested in the intricate details of wallet transactions, including staked positions in DeFi platforms.

**How Wallet Profiling Works**

When you submit a wallet address or connect your existing wallet to Chainlyze, our tool conducts an extensive search across multiple blockchain networks to gather data about the wallet's activities. We support a broad range of EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible chains, ensuring you receive a thorough and detailed analysis.

**Key Features of Wallet Profiling**

* **Multi-Chain Analysis:** We scan various blockchain networks to compile a comprehensive list of all transactions associated with the provided wallet address.
